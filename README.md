# Real-Time-Face-Detection-Application
The application displays the live video stream from the webcam on your screen. When a face is detected in the frame, a green rectangle is drawn around it, providing a clear visual confirmation. This allows you to see your own face or anyone else's in the camera's view with a bounding box indicating their presence.
